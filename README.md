# IlluHuman

Welcome to the IlluHuman project!

This project aims to create an interactive 3D scene using Three.js that features the following elements:
(1) **Walking Human Animation**: A scene where a human model walks, based on the example from Three.js Skinning Animation.
(2) **Additional 3D Human Models**: Change to another 3D character model sourced from platforms like Mixamo and Sketchfab.
(3) **Dynamic Lighting with Spotlight**: A spotlight system, inspired by the Three.js Spotlight Example, will illuminate the models. The spotlight parameters (e.g., intensity, angle, and color) will be adjustable in real time.
(4) **Subsurface Scattering (SSS) Effects**: Implementation of subsurface scattering effects on the human models to simulate realistic skin rendering. The parameters for SSS will be adjustable, similar to the functionality demonstrated in ShaderToyâ€™s SSS example.
